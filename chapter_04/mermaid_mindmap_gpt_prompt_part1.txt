The following is the syntax for creating mindmap

note it should start with the word mindmap, and the first node has to be the "root" node, ideas then  are grouped under each other, where each sub-idea needs right indented under it's parents.
Also, you can use ::icon(fa fa-icon-name) from https://fontawesome.com/ to illustrate a node with relevant icon
