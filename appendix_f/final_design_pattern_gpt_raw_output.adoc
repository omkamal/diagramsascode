=== Design Patterns in Python

Software design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They can be thought of as templates for solving specific problems. Python, with its emphasis on readability and simplicity, offers a unique perspective on the implementation and usage of these patterns.

Brief History: The idea of software design patterns was popularized in the 1990s by the "Gang of Four" in their seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software".

Advantages of Design Patterns in Python:
- Increased code readability and maintainability.
- Leverage Pythonâ€™s features to implement patterns succinctly.
- Easier collaboration with other developers familiar with the patterns.

=== Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

==== Singleton
Ensures a class only has one instance and provides a global point of access.

.Example in Python
[source,python]
----
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

singleton = Singleton()
new_singleton = Singleton()

assert singleton is new_singleton  # True

    Singleton-->>Client: Return _instance
----


=== Structural Patterns

Structural patterns concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects.

==== Adapter
Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.

.Example in Python
[source,python]
----
class OldSystem:
    def old_request(self):
        return "Old system request"

class Adapter(OldSystem):
    def request(self):
        return self.old_request()

adapter = Adapter()
print(adapter.request())  # Old system request
----

    }

    participant OldSystem as OldSystem
    Client->>Adapter: request()
    Adapter->>OldSystem: old_request()
    OldSystem-->>Adapter: Response
    Adapter-->>Client: Adapted Response
----


==== Bridge
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently.

.Example in Python
[source,python]
----
class Implementation:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class ConcreteImplementationA(Implementation):
    def operation(self):
        return "ConcreteImplementationA"

class Abstraction:
    def __init__(self, implementation):
        self._implementation = implementation

    def operation(self):
        return self._implementation.operation()

bridge = Abstraction(ConcreteImplementationA())
print(bridge.operation())  # ConcreteImplementationA
----

        +operation()
    }
    ConcreteImplementationA --> Implementation
    class Abstraction {
        -_implementation
        +operation()
    }
    Abstraction --> Implementation
----

    Abstraction->>ConcreteImplementationA: operation()
    ConcreteImplementationA-->>Abstraction: Return "ConcreteImplementationA"
    Abstraction-->>Client: Return "ConcreteImplementationA"
----

==== Composite
Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

.Example in Python
[source,python]
----
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        pass

class Leaf(Component):
    def operation(self):
        return "Leaf"

class Composite(Component):
    def __init__(self):
        self._children = []

    def add(self, component):
        self._children.append(component)

    def operation(self):
        return [child.operation() for child in self._children]
----

    Leaf1-->>Composite: Return "Leaf"
    Composite->>Leaf2: operation()
    Leaf2-->>Composite: Return "Leaf"
    Composite-->>Client: Return ["Leaf", "Leaf"]
----


==== Decorator
Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object without altering its structure.

.Example in Python
[source,python]
----
class Component:
    def operation(self):
        return "Component"

class Decorator(Component):
    def __init__(self, component):
        self._component = component

    def operation(self):
        return f"Decorator({self._component.operation()})"

Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

    def operationA(self):
        return "SubsystemA"

class SubsystemB:
    def operationB(self):

        self._subsystemA = SubsystemA()
        self._subsystemB = SubsystemB()

    def operation(self, extrinsic_state):
        pass

class ConcreteFlyweight(Flyweight):
    def operation(self, extrinsic_state):

    def request(self):
        return "RealSubject: Handling request."

=== Conclusion

Python's dynamic and expressive nature provides a unique platform to implement and explore design patterns. With the rise of asynchronous programming, patterns are evolving to accommodate concurrent programming paradigms. Leveraging patterns in Python not only ensures robust and maintainable code but also allows developers to stand on the shoulders of giants, benefiting from decades of collective experience and wisdom.
