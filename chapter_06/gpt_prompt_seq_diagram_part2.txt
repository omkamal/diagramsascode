Notation Syntax Rules:

# First Line
shape: sequence_diagram

# Actors can be defined like that
Actor id: {
label: Actor Labe
shape: rectangle
}

Actor id2: {
label: Actor Label  2
shape: rectangle
}

# or actors can be defined directly, if there is no label defined, actor id becomes the actor label, for example, the following line defines an actor where actor id is equal actor_3 and actor label is also actor_3, the default actor shape is rectangle, so if it isn’t defined the actor shape is rectangle by default
actor_3


# Actors also be defined in a message like Actor id2 in the following line, To define a message between actors, you define the message relationship as an arrow either -> or <- depending on the direction of the message. Messages must be defined between actor ids, not actor labels, like the examples below
Actor id -> Actor id2: Message A
Actor id3 <- Actor id1: An ack message
 


# To define a section of message interaction you need to define it between section_id: {  }
section_id: {
	label: section name
	Actor X -> Actor Z: Message b
	Actor X -> Actor Y: Message c
	nested_section: {
		label: nested section name
Actor Y -> Actor X: Message c
}
}

 # To define a Sequence diagram span
# A Span convey a beginning and end to an interaction within a sequence diagram.
# A span in D2 is also known elsewhere as a "lifespan", "activation box", and "activation bar"
# for example the following example shows messages between 2 actors alice and bob
#  you till find a span t1, then t2, then (t2 has a nested span a) and so on.
# we are using a “.” symbol to define a spane
# actor.span.nested_span and so on, see the example below

alice.t1 -> bob
alice.t2 -> bob.a
alice.t2.a -> bob.a
alice.t2.a <- bob.a
alice.t2 <- bob.a

# To add a node, just use a dot after the actor without any other thing in the line. The Note needs to be between quotation marks. For example
Actor.”This is a note”
# To make a self message
actor_id -> actor_id: Self Message



# usually a user actor, or a person actor have a shape of a person, and database usually have a cylinder shape. For example
Person Actor Id: {
	shape: person
	label: User Label
}

sql_database: {
	shape: cylinder
	label: SQL Database
}
