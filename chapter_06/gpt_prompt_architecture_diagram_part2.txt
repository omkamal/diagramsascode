D2 Container Syntax:
# Diagrams can be formed using containers, and containers can have containers inside each other
# Container can be defined using the following attributes, id, shape, label, and others. 
# shapes can be only the following values: 
[ rectangle, image, square, page, parallelogram, document, cylinder, queue, package, step, callout, stored_data, rectangle, square, page, parallelogram, document, cylinder, queue, package, step, callout, stored_data, person, diamond, oval, circle, hexagon, cloud]
# ‘image’ is a special shape, which needs a following line that hold the ‘icon’ attribute. The  ‘icon’ attribute holds the url for the an jpg or png on the web.
# It is very important when you are using a container that have a commercial brand or a well-known product, you can use the icon url used on wikipedia or other public web sources to fill in the icon url.
# If you need to open curly braces, you need to make sure each element statements is in a single line, don't put two attributes together in one line.
# for example, never put the 'shape' attribute and the 'label' attribute on the same line
 
For example

container_id: {
	label: container_label
shape: container_shape
sub_container_id: {
	label: sub_container_label
	shape: sub_container_shape

}

sub_container2_id: {
	label: sub_container2_label
	shape: sub_container2_shape

}
	
	# containers and sub containers can be connected 
# to each others with arrows
sub_container2_id -> sub_container_id

# containers can also be defined without curly braces, for example container3_id is defined below. And an arrow between container3_id and container_id is also defined in the same line.
conatiner3_id -> container_id 

# attributes also can be defined inline using the “.” operator, for example:
continer3_id.shape: rectangle
}



# Icons and images are an essential part of production-ready diagrams.
# You can use any URL as value. And setting the shape attribute to an image, and icon attribute to the url. For example:

github: {
label: Github  
shape: image
  icon: https://icons.terrastruct.com/dev/github.svg
}

# The connection between containers can be identified using the attribute direction, that can have either of those four values up, down, right, and left. For example, in the diagram below, the direction between “database” and “network” containers are from up to down. While the sub containers “server” and “github” inside the container network is from left to right


direction: down

database: {
	label: DynamoDb
	shape: cylinder
}


network: {
	direction: right
	label: VPC
	shape: rectangle 

server: {
 shape: image
icon: https://icons.terrastruct.com/tech/022-server.svg
}

github: {
 shape: image
icon: https://icons.terrastruct.com/dev/github.svg
}

server -> github
}

database -> network

# container can be connected to sub container using the full container address, also you can put a label over the arrow or the edge between containers
continer_id -> container_id2.sub_container_id_3: edge_label

# When connecting sub_containers to each other outside their local scope, you need to define their full container name, in other terms, the whole path.
container_id2.sub_container_id_1: -> container_id2.sub_container_id_3: edge_label
# You can just say if:
sub_container_id_1: -> sub_container_id_3: edge_label
# However, is the conntection line is written with the curly braces of the parent container, you don't need that full path format.
# For example:
  container1: {
    label: "Plotting Results"
    shape: rectangle

    sub_container1: {
      label: "sub_container1_label"
      shape: package
    }
    sub_container2 {
      label: "sub_container2_label"
      shape: package
    }
  sub_container2 -> sub_container1: edge_label
}
