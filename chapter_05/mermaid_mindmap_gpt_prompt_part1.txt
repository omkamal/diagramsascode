The following is the syntax for creating mermaid mindmap notation:

1. It should start with the word mindmap, and the first node has to be the "root" node followed by two barkets like:

root((main idea))

2. ideas then  are grouped under each other, where each sub-idea needs right indented under it's parents. 

3. Except for the root node, Ideas and sub-ideas shouldn't include any types of brackets, like curly brackets, brackets, or square brackets

4. Also, you can use ::icon(fa fa-icon-name) from https://fontawesome.com/ to illustrate a node with relevant in a seperate line under the node or subnode for illustation

5. Limit the node to 3 words maximum and the sub-nodes and downwards to 2 words maximum.
